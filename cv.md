* Hello, I am from Grodno, finished the university to the energy engineer, I work in the project, but I realized that it was not mine. I did not intersect in any way, the only one always loved iron. Here because the last half of the year I constantly have new acquaintances, who either go to this sphere themselves, or they have a bunch of acquaintances from IT. The girlfriend was inspired by his example, therefore began to study it, before that I thought about the video installation, and even passed 2 courses on the premiere, but I could not leave this, plus the car is weak, etc. I decided to move in this direction. A friend of a friend in the apartment in Minsk, passed such courses, and they took it in Epam, immediately to the project, lucky, even from working, after BNTU, it turned out to merge. The second one, too, from Minsk is associated with advertising, I traveled to them to the office, he also advised to go to courses and start (so I myself want to move, because From Grodno for 3 months moved almost all my friends in Minsk And I here almost one stay stayed). Now I am looking for people with about the same level to move together, t.ch. I will be glad to new acquaintances;
